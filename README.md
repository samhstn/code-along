After cloning, set up the pre-commit hook as follows:

```bash
cat .pre-commit > .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

It can be quite confusing as to where to look for programming resources.
Here is a note of where to look for each programming language or technology:
Python - https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html and https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/
Erlang - https://learnyousomeerlang.com/
Haskell - http://learnyouahaskell.com/
Prolog - http://www.learnprolognow.org/
Postgresql - https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/
